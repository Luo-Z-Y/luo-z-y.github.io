        <h1>Auteur Approach: Satoshi Kon</h1>
        <p>
            The auteur approach holds that a film’s director is its “author”
            (French, auteur). It originated in France in the 1950s and seeks to
            identify the person most responsible for the creation of a film,
            namely the director. This term is often used to differentiate art
            film directors from Hollywood’s commercial film directors. Auteurs
            often work with the art cinema, which “addresses its audience as one
            of knowledgeable cinemagoers who will recognise the characteristic
            stylistic touches of the author’s oeuvre” (Pam, 2019). In this
            light, auteurs use film techniques like mise-en-scene,
            cinematography, editing, and sound as per the need of their unique
            narrative, which often stresses meaning and value over popularity.
            According to Andrew Sarris, there are three premises for auteur
            theory, which are technical competence, personality, and interior
            meaning (Sarris, 2007). Under this framework, Satoshi Kon is a prime
            example of an auteur deserving of the title, from his creation of
            astonishing and ageless pictures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kon’s most iconic signature in films is his match cut editing, this
            technique is often used to match scene transitions. The beginning
            four minutes of <i>Paprika</i> has five sequences which all occur in
            a dream. It features therapist Paprika who is in detective Konakawa
            Toshimi’s dream (like the film <i>Inception</i>, which made its
            debut 4 years later), and together they are chasing after a suspect
            among totally different scenarios, and match cuts help to relate
            them. Initially Konakawa was in a circus, his circus stunt in the
            air is mapped to swinging among trees in a forest. Then the vines on
            the tree are changed to a thin wire a man uses to attempt to kill
            Konakawa, and the setting changes to a train, Paprika uses a
            briefcase to hit the man on his head to rescue Konakawa and the
            briefcase changes to a guitar.
        </p>
        <p>
            The transition of scenes goes on with match cuts. Kon is playful
            with connecting films of different genres. The sequence pays homage
            to <i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i> (1952), the Tarzan series,
            <i>From Russia with Love</i> (1963), and <i>Roman Holiday</i> (1953)
            (Kerin, 2010). This makes the beginning chaotic and hard to follow,
            and it may seem unrealistic even for a dream. Yet, Kon did all those
            purposefully to highlight the surrealism, which seeks to release the
            unbridled imagination of the subconscious (James, 2000). He wants
            the audience to connect to the film subconsciously, and inside the
            film is a space where common logic may fail, and reality is
            distorted. Through the shifting identities of Konakawa, the audience
            experiences the power of cinema which could change their
            perspectives and identities as well. The match cut is a perfect tool
            to emphasise continuity and connection despite the swift
            transitions. It also attracts the audience to become actively
            engaged in the film. The audience find association between pictures
            and unleash their imagination to interpret Konakawa’s dream. What
            seems bizarre on screen is perfectly normal for Konakawa in his
            dream, for we could all be fine with even the strangest thing in our
            subconscious world. Once the audience immerse in Konakawa’s dream,
            the distinction between reality and virtuality becomes vague and
            therefore they could indulge themselves in the temporal escapism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kon’s fast paced editing in Paprika also resembles the hasty tempo
            of life which people have today. Kon likes ellipsis and would
            sometimes jump past part of a scene, to speed up even more, he uses
            fewer frames for swift actions as compared to other films. All Kon’s
            films are around 90 minutes. Kon believes that today, as an
            individual or part of the society, we are constantly sensing the
            world at a faster rate (Every Frame a Painting, 2014). Sometimes we
            are simply overwhelmed by how much information we possess but could
            not process. In Paprika, when doctor Toratarō Shima falls victim to
            the research prototype device DC Mini which can alter people’s dream
            and goes on a nonsensical tirade, he jumps through a window. Instead
            of showing how Toratarō falls, Kon stops here and later shows that
            he is hospitalised. In between the two scenes, we are dragged into
            Shima’s invaded mind where refrigerator, hydrant, the Statue of
            Liberty, and many other different objects are marching together with
            music which the audience could not tell whether diegetic or not as
            different toys are playing symphony at the same time.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Such a crazy dream is the perfect manifestation of the chaos felt by
            Shima when his brain is intruded by DC Mini, and the audience could
            relate. In fact, Kon wants the audience to feel a sense of absurdity
            and lost not only in the cinema world but also in their real world.
            Kon likes to use the modern Japanese world as the place of his
            stories. Establishing shots are given to the central business
            regions, where sign boards and neon light occupy the whole screen
            ostentatiously. This is in line with the future digital dystopia he
            has envisioned for Paprika, a world where the relationship between
            people becomes more alienated thanks to technology. The
            interweavement of cold tone of the concrete jungle in real world and
            the bright colour in the dream makes his film visually impactful,
            and it further underscores the common issue people today are facing,
            as they are disappointed by their life, and they can only find
            consolation in other worlds like in the dream or in the film. To
            Kon, there is not much difference between the film and dream. A
            dream is merely a film in our minds. The detective Konakawa in fact
            used to have a dream of being a director, which he shared with his
            best friend. This is why Paprika finds him in a theatre in his
            dream, and he explains film techniques like the classic 180-degree
            rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this becomes his lifelong regret as he eventually gave it
            up. The final scene of his last film, in which the hero shoots the
            villain, occurs recursively in his dream, and it bites his in the
            foot and infiltrates his memory when in reality he was chasing after
            the suspect along the hotel corridor. Kon wants to construct an
            interesting relationship among the film, dream and reality. What
            does Konakawa’s dream mean to Paprika? Who has been consciously
            involved and is aware of the fact she is in a dream. Kon has the
            left the audience at the same position as Paprika, together we are
            all in another world, where we have certain superpowers (Paprika
            becomes Wukong and starts flying, and we audience withhold the power
            of observing without being noticed), yet we are interacting with the
            elements inside the other world, through which we are subjected to
            manipulation emotionally and physically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kon has negative perception of technology in his films due to the
            concern over abusive usage, this renders his films pessimistic
            outlook. In Perfect Blue, the protagonist Mima Kirigoe was a former
            pop singer who decides to pursue an acting career. However, her
            transition into the acting world proves to be a difficult and
            traumatic experience, as she struggles to cope with the pressures of
            her new profession and the mysterious stalker who seems to be
            obsessed with her. In the film, technology plays a role in
            fragmentise and reduce her to become mere images for different
            people. The camera, internet, and television screen are used to
            amplify certain personalities of her while ignoring her as a person,
            as if she is a toy for others to play with. However, I argue that
            Kon films are really all about good endings. Across all Kon’s films,
            he is almost always focusing on the struggle of young females, and
            how they overcome the difficulties. Be it the mischievous Chiyoko
            Fujiwara in Millennium Actress, the sweetheart idol Mima Kirigoe in
            Perfect Blue or even the motherly figure Hana in Tokyo Godfathers.
            They are all portrayed as the positive, brave, and almost angelic
            figure. Although in the Japanese anime industry, many works have
            female leading characters for the sake of attracting male audience,
            females are sexualised and they are often written not as characters
            by rather as objects. It is not the case for Kon’s films. His films
            are never about women relying on men. Girls in Kon’s films do not
            need male saviours, they are the master of their own destiny.
            Despite the harsh reality, Mima eventually succeeded in her career.
            Of course, the audience should take Kon’s warning regarding toxic
            celebrity culture, and how technology could be misused for cyber
            stalkers. In Paprika, Doctor Atsuko Chiba is the protagonist with a
            dual identity. The two sides of her have drastically different
            personalities. Being a research scientist, she is calm and quiet,
            but as Paprika in the dream world, she becomes adventurous and
            proactive. Paprika resembles more to Kon’s general depiction of all
            the protagonists in his films. The existence of Paprika also
            challenges people’s perception of dream, as they see it as something
            stimulated by the actual world. Paprika lives as an individual and
            she is not under the control of Chiba, she even makes appearances in
            Chiba’s real life. She is neither a reflection nor a puppet, even
            though she is fantasised by Chiba.
        </p>
        <p>
            When being asked about what message he wanted to convey in Perfect
            Blue during an interview, Kon said, “The real-life images and
            virtual images come and go quickly in the film. When you are
            watching the film, you sometimes feel like losing yourself in
            whichever world you are watching, real or virtual. But after going
            back and forth between the real world and the virtual world, you
            eventually find your own identity through your own powers. Nobody
            can help you do this. You are ultimately the only person who can
            truly find a place where you know you belong. (Kon, 1997)” This has
            not changed in the film Paprika, in which Doctor Chiba eventually
            realises that she should not dodge reality anymore. This is obvious
            at the end of the film when Paprika leaves Chiba, as Chiba no longer
            needs Paprika in her world. Paprika used to be the one who is braver
            and more confident, but Chiba has grown and she now could embrace
            the reality. Detective Konakawa also reconciled with himself and
            recognised that being a police officer is no different to his
            childhood dream of acting as a man who stands by the side of justice
            in a film. Most of Kon’s films are convoluted and confusing, so it
            might be hard to find the essence of his films. But I think
            Millennium Actress has provided a straight-forward answer. The
            protagonist Chiyoko Fujiwara has been looking for a man she loves
            for her whole life, but she is doomed to fail as we audience know
            that the man died long time ago. Kon does not think Fujiwara’s
            searching as futile. To him, the journey of pursuing something
            itself is meaningful. And more importantly, the determination and a
            clear goal help to craft one’s identity. Kon’s films serves as a
            metacommentary to film itself, he confuses the audience with
            different layers of dreams and the merge between dream and reality
            in Paprika. He displays the manipulative power of films to its
            extreme. But what matters is that we stay afloat of the torrents
            laced by dream and reality. Escapism is not the ultimate solution,
            the only way to fight back to the absurdity of life to not succumb
            to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kon died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 46 in 2010 and left
            behind an unfinished potential masterpiece Dreaming Machine.
            However, he has already started the invention of Dream Machine long
            time ago, and the objective of such a creation is clear: By
            underscoring both the beauty and danger of the dream, he wants
            people to fulfil themselves in their real life. Perhaps it is
            destined for a film titled Dreaming Machine to not make its way to
            the real world.
